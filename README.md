# Car-pool
Creating a repository so that my teammates can contribute in developing Hack-a-pool project.This project is based on the idea that if 4 people has to go to the same destination from the same location then instead of booking cabs one by one,a chat box will be created and based on the convenience of the passengers ,they can book one common cab and reach their common destination.

Technology used:
Frontend-HTML,CSS,Javascript,Bootstrap
